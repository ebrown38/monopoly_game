Script to play a game of monopoly and collect stats on it

All You have to do is run the Main.py file and the games will start playing. The script will print out what iteration it is on for every 1000 games that are played.
The entire game playes a whole game of Monopoly with 2-6 players for each round, with 1 Million rounds in total being played. The script took me 6 hours to run, 
so make sure you have some spare time for it to run fully. When completed, it will output a JSON object.
